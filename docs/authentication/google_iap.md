# Google IAP

Setting up Google IAP authentication will protect all routes of your Livebook instance. It is particularly useful for adding authentication to Livebook instances with deployed notebooks. Google IAP authentication occurs in addition to [Livebook's authentication](../authentication.md) for deployed notebooks and admins.

Once Google IAP is enabled, we recommend leaving the "/public" route of your instances still public. This route is used for integration with the [Livebook Badge](https://livebook.dev/badge/) and other conveniences.

## How to

To integrate your Google Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) authentication with Livebook,
set the `LIVEBOOK_IDENTITY_PROVIDER` environment variable to `google_iap:<your-jwt-audience>`.

For more information about Google IAP, see https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/concepts-overview.

Only access with Google accounts is supported. See https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/authenticate-users-google-accounts.

For more details about how to find your JWT audience, see https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/signed-headers-howto and look for "Signed Header JWT Audience."

## Livebook Teams

[Livebook Teams](https://livebook.dev/teams/) users can deploy notebooks with the click of a button with built-in authentication via Livebook Teams. You can also pre-configure environment variables (such as `LIVEBOOK_IDENTITY_PROVIDER`), share team secrets, and file storages. Both online and airgapped deployment mechanisms are supported.

Furthermore, if you are deploying multi-session apps via [Livebook Teams](https://livebook.dev/teams/), you can programmatically access data from the authenticated user by calling [`Kino.Workspace.app_info/0`](https://hexdocs.pm/kino/Kino.Workspace.html#app_info/0).

To get started, open up Livebook, click "Add Organization" on the sidebar. Then, inside the notebook of your choice, click "Deploy with Livebook Teams".
