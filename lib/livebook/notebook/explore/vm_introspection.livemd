# Fun with VM introspection

## Introduction

In this notebook we manually establish connection to a running node,
and then we try to retrieve and plot some interesting information
about the system.

## Setup

We are definitely gonna plot some data in this notebook,
so let's add `:vega_lite` and `:kino` for that.

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:vega_lite, "~> 0.1.2"},
  {:kino, "~> 0.3.1", github: "livebook-dev/kino"}
])
```

```elixir
alias VegaLite, as: Vl
```

## Connecting to a remote node

The first thing we need is a separate Elixir node. In practice,
you would start an external Elixir system, such as by running the
following in your production app:

```
iex --name my_app@IP -S mix TASK
```

Or by connecting to a production node assembled via
[`mix release`](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Release.html).

For convenience, however, you can simply start [a new notebook](/explore/notebooks/new),
since Livebook automatically starts each notebook as a remote node.

Once you start a new notebook, you can find its node name and
cookie by running the following inside an Elixir cell:

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
IO.puts node()
IO.puts Node.get_cookie()
```

Now render the inputs below:

```elixir
node_input = Kino.Input.text("Node")
cookie_input = Kino.Input.text("Cookie")
```

And paste the node name and the cookie value from the other node inside.

Now let's read the inputs, configure the cookie, and connect to the other notebook:

```elixir
node =
  node_input
  |> Kino.Input.read()
  |> String.to_atom()

cookie =
  cookie_input
  |> Kino.Input.read()
  |> String.to_atom()

Node.set_cookie(node, cookie)
true = Node.connect(node)
```

Having successfully connected, let's try spawning a process
on the remote node!

```elixir
Node.spawn(node, fn ->
  IO.inspect(node())
end)
```

From the result of `node/1` it's clear that the function was evaluated
remotely, but note that we still get the standard output back.

## Inspecting processes

Now we are going to extract some information from the running node on our own!

Let's get the list of all processes in the system:

```elixir
remote_pids = :rpc.call(node, Process, :list, [])
```

Wait, but what is this `:rpc.call/4` thing? 🤔

Previously we used `Node.spawn/2` to run a process on the other node
and we used the `IO` module to get some output. However, now
we actually care about the resulting value of `Process.list/0`!

We could still use `Node.spawn/2` to send us the results, which
we would `receive`, but doing that over and over can be quite tedious.
Fortunately, `:rpc.call/4` does essentially that - evaluates the given
function on the remote node and returns its result.

Now, let's gather more information about each process 🕵️

```elixir
processes =
  Enum.map(remote_pids, fn pid ->
    # Extract interesting process information
    info = :rpc.call(node, Process, :info, [pid, [:reductions, :memory, :status]])
    # The result of inspect(pid) is relative to the node
    # where it was called, that's why we call it on the remote node
    pid_inspect = :rpc.call(node, Kernel, :inspect, [pid])

    %{
      pid: pid_inspect,
      reductions: info[:reductions],
      memory: info[:memory],
      status: info[:status]
    }
  end)
```

Having all that data, we can now visualize it on a scatter plot!

```elixir
Vl.new(width: 600, height: 400)
|> Vl.data_from_values(processes)
|> Vl.mark(:point, tooltip: true)
|> Vl.encode_field(:x, "reductions", type: :quantitative, scale: [type: "log", base: 10])
|> Vl.encode_field(:y, "memory", type: :quantitative, scale: [type: "log", base: 10])
|> Vl.encode_field(:color, "status", type: :nominal)
|> Vl.encode_field(:tooltip, "pid", type: :nominal)
```

From the plot we can easily see which processes do the most work
and take the most memory.

## Tracking memory usage

There's a very simple way to determine current memory usage in the VM:

```elixir
:erlang.memory()
```

We can use `Kino.VegaLite.periodically/4` to create a self-updating
plot of memory usage over time on the remote node!

```elixir
widget =
  Vl.new(width: 600, height: 400, padding: 20)
  |> Vl.repeat(
    [layer: ["total", "processes", "atom", "binary", "code", "ets"]],
    Vl.new()
    |> Vl.mark(:line)
    |> Vl.encode_field(:x, "iter", type: :quantitative, title: "Measurement")
    |> Vl.encode_repeat(:y, :layer, type: :quantitative, title: "Memory usage (MB)")
    |> Vl.encode(:color, datum: [repeat: :layer], type: :nominal)
  )
  |> Kino.VegaLite.new()
  |> tap(&Kino.render/1)

Kino.VegaLite.periodically(widget, 200, 1, fn i ->
  point =
    :rpc.call(node, :erlang, :memory, [])
    |> Enum.map(fn {type, bytes} -> {type, bytes / 1_000_000} end)
    |> Map.new()
    |> Map.put(:iter, i)

  Kino.VegaLite.push(widget, point, window: 1000)
  {:cont, i + 1}
end)
```

Unless you connected to a production node, the memory usage
most likely doesn't change, so to emulate some spikes you can
run the following code in the remote node:

**Binary usage**

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
x = Enum.reduce(1..10_000, [], fn i, acc ->
  [String.duplicate("cat", i) | acc]
end)
```

**ETS usage**

<!-- livebook:{"force_markdown":true} -->

```elixir
tid = :ets.new(:users, [:set, :public])

for i <- 1..1_000_000 do
  :ets.insert(tid, {i, "User #{i}"})
end
```
