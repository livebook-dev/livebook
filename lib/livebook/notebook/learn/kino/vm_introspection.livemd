# Runtime introspection with Mermaid and VegaLite

```elixir
Mix.install([
  {:kino, "~> 0.10.0"},
  {:kino_vega_lite, "~> 0.1.7"}
])
```

## Introduction

In this notebook, we will explore how to use `Kino` and `VegaLite`
to learn how Elixir works and plot how our system behaves over
time. If you are not familiar with VegaLite, [read
its introductory notebook](/learn/notebooks/intro-to-vega-lite).

Both `Kino` and `VegaLite` have been listed as dependencies in the
setup cell.

## Processes all the way down

All Elixir code runs inside lightweight processes. You can get
the identifier of the current process by calling `self()`:

```elixir
self()
```

We can create literally millions of those processes. They all
run at the same time and they communicate via message passing:

```elixir
parent = self()

child =
  spawn(fn ->
    receive do
      :ping -> send(parent, :pong)
    end
  end)

send(child, :ping)

receive do
  :pong -> :ponged!
end
```

The code above starts a child process. This processes waits
for a `:ping` message and replies to the parent with `:pong`.
The parent then returns `:ponged!` once it receives the pong.

Wouldn't it be nice if we could also _visualize_ how this
communication happens? We can do so by using `Kino.Process`!

With `Kino.Process.render_seq_trace/1`, we can ask Kino to
draw a [Mermaid diagram](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) with
all messages to and from the current process:

```elixir
parent = self()

Kino.Process.render_seq_trace(fn ->
  child =
    spawn(fn ->
      receive do
        :ping -> send(parent, :pong)
      end
    end)

  send(child, :ping)

  receive do
    :pong -> :ponged!
  end
end)
```

You can use `render_seq_trace` any time you want to
peek under the hood and learn more about any Elixir
code. For instance, Elixir has module called `Task`.
This module contains functions that starts processes
to perform temporary computations and return their
results. What would happen if we were to spawn four
tasks, sleep by a random amount, and collect their
results?

```elixir
Kino.Process.render_seq_trace(fn ->
  1..4
  |> Task.async_stream(fn i ->
    Process.sleep(Enum.random(100..300))
    i
  end)
  |> Stream.run()
end)
```

Every time you execute the above, you will get
a different order, and you can visualize how
`Task.async_stream/2` is starting different processes
which return at different times.

## Supervisors: a special type of process

In the previous section we learned about one special
type of processes, called tasks. There are other types
of processes, such as agents and servers, but there is
one particular category that stands out, which are the
supervisors.

Supervisors are processes that supervisor other processes
and restart them in case something goes wrong. We can start
our own supervisor like this:

```elixir
{:ok, supervisor} =
  Supervisor.start_link(
    [
      {Task, fn -> Process.sleep(:infinity) end},
      {Agent, fn -> [] end}
    ],
    strategy: :one_for_one
  )
```

The above started a supervision tree. Now let's visualize it:

```elixir
Kino.Process.render_sup_tree(supervisor)
```

In fact, you don't even need to call `render_sup_tree`. If you
simply return a `supervisor`, Livebook will return a tabbed
output where one of the possible visualizations is the supervision
tree:

```elixir
supervisor
```

And we can go even further!

Sometimes a supervisor may be supervised by another supervisor,
which may have be supervised by another supervisor, and so on.
This defines a **supervision tree**. We then package those supervision
trees into applications. `Kino` itself is an application and
we can visualize its tree:

```elixir
Kino.Process.render_app_tree(:kino)
```

Even Elixir itself is an application:

```elixir
Kino.Process.render_app_tree(:elixir)
```

You can get the list of all currently running applications with:

```elixir
Application.started_applications()
```

Feel free to dig deeper and visualize those applications at your
own pace!

## Connecting to a remote node

Processes have one more trick up their sleeve: processes can
communicate with each other even if they run on different
machines! However, to do so, we must first connect the nodes
together.

In order to connect two nodes, we need to know their node name
and their cookie. We can get this information for the current
Livebook like this:

```elixir
IO.puts node()
IO.puts Node.get_cookie()
```

Where does this information come from? Inside notebooks, Livebook
takes care of setting those for you. In development, you would
specify those directly in the command line:

```
iex --name my_app@IP -S mix TASK
```

In production, those are often part of your
[`mix release`](https://hexdocs.pm/mix/Mix.Tasks.Release.html)
configuration.

Now let's connect the nodes together. We will capture the node name
and cookie using Kino inputs. However, for convenience, we will use
the node and cookie of the current notebook as default values. This
means that, if you don't have a separate node, the runtime will
connect and introspect itself. Let's render the inputs:

```elixir
node_input = Kino.Input.text("Node", default: node())
cookie_input = Kino.Input.text("Cookie", default: Node.get_cookie())

Kino.render(node_input)
Kino.render(cookie_input)
:ok
```

Now let's read the inputs, configure the cookie, and connect to the
other node:

```elixir
node =
  node_input
  |> Kino.Input.read()
  |> String.to_atom()

cookie =
  cookie_input
  |> Kino.Input.read()
  |> String.to_atom()

Node.set_cookie(node, cookie)
true = Node.connect(node)
```

Having successfully connected, let's try spawning a process
on the remote node!

```elixir
Node.spawn(node, fn ->
  IO.inspect(node())
end)
```

## Inspecting remote processes

Now we are going to extract some information from the running node on our own!

Let's get the list of all processes in the system:

```elixir
remote_pids = :erpc.call(node, Process, :list, [])
```

Wait, what is this `:erpc.call/4` thing? 🤔

Previously we used `Node.spawn/2` to run a process on the other node
and we used the `IO` module to get some output. However, now
we actually care about the resulting value of `Process.list/0`!

We could still use `Node.spawn/2` to send us the results, which
we would `receive`, but doing that over and over can be quite tedious.
Fortunately, `:erpc.call/4` does essentially that - evaluates the given
function on the remote node and returns its result.

Now, let's gather more information about each process: 🕵️

```elixir
processes =
  Enum.map(remote_pids, fn pid ->
    # Extract interesting process information
    info = :erpc.call(node, Process, :info, [pid, [:reductions, :memory, :status]])
    # The result of inspect(pid) is relative to the node
    # where it was called, that's why we call it on the remote node
    pid_inspect = :erpc.call(node, Kernel, :inspect, [pid])

    %{
      pid: pid_inspect,
      reductions: info[:reductions],
      memory: info[:memory],
      status: info[:status]
    }
  end)
```

Having all that data, we can now visualize it on a scatter plot
using VegaLite:

```elixir
alias VegaLite, as: Vl

Vl.new(width: 600, height: 400)
|> Vl.data_from_values(processes)
|> Vl.mark(:point, tooltip: true)
|> Vl.encode_field(:x, "reductions", type: :quantitative, scale: [type: "log", base: 10])
|> Vl.encode_field(:y, "memory", type: :quantitative, scale: [type: "log", base: 10])
|> Vl.encode_field(:color, "status", type: :nominal)
|> Vl.encode_field(:tooltip, "pid", type: :nominal)
```

From the plot we can easily see which processes do the most work
and take the most memory.

## Tracking memory usage

So far we have used VegaLite to draw static plots. However, we can use
Kino to dynamically push data to VegaLite. Let's use them together
to plot the runtime memory usage over time.

There's a very simple way to determine current memory usage in the VM:

```elixir
:erlang.memory()
```

Now let's build a dynamic VegaLite graph. Instead of returning the
VegaLite specification as is, we will wrap it in `Kino.VegaLite.new/1`
to make it dynamic:

```elixir
memory_plot =
  Vl.new(width: 600, height: 400, padding: 20)
  |> Vl.repeat(
    [layer: ["total", "processes", "atom", "binary", "code", "ets"]],
    Vl.new()
    |> Vl.mark(:line)
    |> Vl.encode_field(:x, "iter", type: :quantitative, title: "Measurement")
    |> Vl.encode_repeat(:y, :layer, type: :quantitative, title: "Memory usage (MB)")
    |> Vl.encode(:color, datum: [repeat: :layer], type: :nominal)
  )
  |> Kino.VegaLite.new()
```

Now we can use `Kino.VegaLite.periodically/4` to create a self-updating
plot of memory usage over time on the remote node:

```elixir
Kino.VegaLite.periodically(memory_plot, 200, 1, fn i ->
  point =
    :erpc.call(node, :erlang, :memory, [])
    |> Enum.map(fn {type, bytes} -> {type, bytes / 1_000_000} end)
    |> Map.new()
    |> Map.put(:iter, i)

  Kino.VegaLite.push(memory_plot, point, window: 1000)
  {:cont, i + 1}
end)
```

Unless you connected to a production node, the memory usage
most likely doesn't change, so to emulate some spikes within
the current notebook, you can run the following code:

**Binary usage**

```elixir
for i <- 1..10_000 do
  String.duplicate("cat", i)
end
```

**ETS usage**

```elixir
tid = :ets.new(:users, [:set, :public])

for i <- 1..1_000_000 do
  :ets.insert(tid, {i, "User #{i}"})
end
```

In this notebook, we learned how powerful Kino and Livebook
are together. With them, we can augment existing Elixir
constructs, such as supervisors, with rich information, but
also to create new visualizations such as VegaLite charts.

In the next notebook, we will learn [how to create our custom
Kinos with Elixir and JavaScript](/learn/notebooks/custom-kinos)!
