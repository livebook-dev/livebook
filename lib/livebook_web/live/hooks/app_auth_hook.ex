  # For apps with password, we want to store the hashed password
  # (let's call it token) in the session, as we do for the main auth.
  # However, the session uses cookies, which have a ~4kb size limit.
  # We could use multiple cookies, however there are also limits on
  # the number of cookies, and we don't want the browser to clear
  # them all at some point. Additionally, accumulating cookies for
  # all apps would imply larger payloads on every regular request.
  #
  # Since we don't have any persistence on the server side, the other
  # option is to use the browser local storage and manage it through
  # JavaScript. Therefore, the whole auth is built using LiveView.
  # The flows are:
  #
  #   * unauthenticated - the auth LiveView shows a regular form and
  #     validates the user-provided password. Once the password is
  #     correct, it pushes an event to the client to store the token.
  #     Once the token is stored it redirects to the app page.
  #
  #   * authenticated - on dead render the app LiveView renders just
  #     a loading screen. On the client side, provided it's the app
  #     page, we read the token from local storage (if stored) and
  #     send it in mount connect params via the socket. Then on the
  #     server we use that token to authenticate.
  #
  # This module defines a hook that sets the following assigns:
  #
  #   * `:app_authenticated?` - reflects the current authentication.
  #     For public apps (or in case the user has full access) it is
  #     set to `true` on both dead and live render
  #
  #   * `:livebook_authenticated?` - if the user has full Livebook
  #     access
  #
  #   * `:app_settings` - the current app settings
  #
