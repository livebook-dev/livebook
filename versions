# When bumping the Erlang/OTP version, make sure the rebar3 version
# supports that Erlang/OTP. Erlang/OTP guarantees byte code compatibility
# across three versions. So, for example, if Rebar3 is compiled for 26,
# then the executable will be good for 26..28. You can find the executable
# version in Rebar3 CI files.
